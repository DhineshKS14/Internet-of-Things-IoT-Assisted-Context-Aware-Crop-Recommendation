# IoT and Machine Learning-Based Crop Recommendation System

## Overview

Precision agriculture is essential for promoting sustainability and profitability in modern farming. Traditional crop recommendation systems often overlook real-time factors such as crop types and soil characteristics, making them less effective. To address these challenges, this project proposes a machine learning-based crop recommendation methodology that leverages real-time soil characteristics captured through IoT-enabled soil sensors. By integrating real-time data into the decision-making process, this system aims to significantly enhance the accuracy of crop recommendations.

## Project Objectives

- **Real-Time Soil Data Collection**: Implement an IoT architecture to capture real-time soil characteristics, providing crucial context for accurate crop and fertilizer recommendations.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilize machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), to evaluate and improve crop recommendation accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compare the IoT-assisted fertility mapping with traditional soil chemical analysis methods, focusing on Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) levels to validate the system’s accuracy.
- **Context-Aware Recommendations**: Provide timely, context-aware crop recommendations for sustainable and profitable agriculture based on the best-performing machine learning model.
